MERN FULLSTACK PROJECT -- BACKEND

Welcome to the backend code repository of my first MERN fullstack portfolio project, SECURE BANK. This backend is a RESTful API utilizing MongoDB for database management, 
Express.js for routing, and Node.js for as the runtime environment. CRUD operations are employed throughout this application to integrate and implement user functionality across the deployed application.
This application is deployed on "Render: Cloud Application Hosting for Developers"-- the backend is deployed as web service.  Enjoy exploring the backend code of SECURE BANK!
